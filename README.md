#### Goal
Get more familiar with TypeScript classes. Understand how to use TypeScript Interfaces effectively to enable more code re-use. We'll create User and Company entities and randomly populate their fields with 'faker'. Most important amongst these fields is their location (longitude and latitude). Then we'll use their location values to show them as markers on a Google map inside your browser.
