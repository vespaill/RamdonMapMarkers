-   Understand how to use TypeScript Interfaces effectively to enable more code re-use.
-   Create User and Company entities and randomly populate their fields with 'faker'. Most important amongst these fields is their location (longitude and latitude).
-   Use location values of these entities to show them as markers on a Google map inside a browser.
